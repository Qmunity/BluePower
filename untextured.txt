Blocks
******

[computer blocks] most have existing basic texture to work from. 
cpu_front (up for debate as to what design, for some reason mirrored on the block)
cpu_side (for some reason it's rotated on the block though)
cpu_back
cpu_top
cpu_bottom
disk_drive_front (red dots are activity lights, so need unlit version as well)
monitor_front (for some reason mirrored on the block)
io_expander_front (temp textures needed, final design relies on implementation of activity lights and also should be half height block)
io_expander_back (temp textures needed, final design relies on bundled cable shape/texture and also should be half height block))
windmill

Items
*****
stone_redwire (is called Stone_wire) stone_wire and stone_redwire are different, stone_redwire should be thicker (difference between red alloy wire and redstone in the recipe)

fine_wire_coil
wool_card
plate_assembly

floppy_disk (no existing texture)

Crushed Tungsten Ore (Ic2 compact)
Tungsten Dust (Ic2 compact)
Purified Crushed Tungsten Ore (Ic2 compact)
Tungsten tiny dust (Ic2 compact)

Sorting Machine:
Sorting Machine has some missing mode icons. All pull modes are missing, and the last 2 sort modes. This is based on http://integratedredstone.wikispaces.com/Redpower+Machine#Blutricity-Sorting Machine
If you add them to the texture file, it would be nice if you could place the pull modes in the gap I made, and the last two sort modes under the other ones. All in order would be nice :) tnx! MineMaarten

Also, color widgets in GUI's are now rendered in code, so they don't have to be hard-placed in GUI textures :)
